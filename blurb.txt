Category:		1 (the contest)

Description:  	Cheril must obtain the Skull of Podewwwr and use its power to
				become a goddess. In order to do so, she must open three gates
				and unlock a magic column.

				The gates are magically locked by the temples of Stone, Paper 
				and Scissors. You must break the seals using the proper 
				medallion in each temple, which you have to find.

				The magic column is unlocked using a key in the keyhole located
				next to the column.

				Cheril can get three magic charges from the pedestals with two
				hearts engraved. He can use such charges to gain super powers
				for a short while (being able to fly around and becoming invin-
				cible) or to activate teleporters which will take her to the
				center of the map.

				You can open the gates and the magic column in any order. You
				can also take a look at a map telling you where everything is
				located. You can only carry one object at a time.
